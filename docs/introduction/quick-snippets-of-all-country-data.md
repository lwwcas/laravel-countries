## Fillable data

## GeoJSON Structure

**GeoJSON** (Geographic JSON) is a format for encoding geographic data structures using JSON. It is widely used in mapping applications and geospatial analysis to represent various geographical features like points, lines, and polygons.

## Use Cases of GeoJSON

GeoJSON is commonly used in various applications, such as:

### 1. **Mapping Applications**

- Used in interactive maps to display geographic data like country borders, rivers, roads, and regions.
- Example: Displaying country borders with **MultiPolygon**.

### 2. **Geospatial Analysis**

- Used to perform geospatial analysis, such as measuring distances, areas, or determining if a point lies within a certain region.
- Example: Determining whether a GPS coordinate falls within a polygon representing a country.

### 3. **Data Visualization**

- Used in data visualization tools to overlay geographical data on maps for insights, such as population density, climate data, and election results.
- Example: Visualizing a country‚Äôs boundary overlaid with population density.

### 4. **API Integration**

- Many APIs (such as geolocation services or environmental data providers) use GeoJSON to return geographic data in a structured format.
- Example: Using a GeoJSON response from an API to plot data points on a map.

## üáßüá∑ Brazil GeoJSON Complete

This GeoJSON object represents the full geographical boundaries of Brazil, utilizing the **FeatureCollection** structure and a **MultiPolygon** geometry type to handle the complexity of the country's borders, including islands and coastal regions. Below, we break down the key components relevant to developers working with geospatial data:

### üîë Key Components

1. **FeatureCollection**:
   - The root object is a **FeatureCollection**, which is a standard GeoJSON structure that contains multiple **Feature** objects. In this case, it encapsulates Brazil‚Äôs geographic representation.

2. **Feature**:
   - Each **Feature** represents a single geographic entity. Here, Brazil is represented as a **Feature**, with metadata included in the **properties** section. This modular design allows developers to easily manage multiple geographic objects within a single **FeatureCollection**.

3. **Properties**:
   - The **properties** object holds non-spatial data about the feature. In this example, the ISO Alpha-2 country code `"br"` is included as a property under `"cca2"`. These properties can be extended to include additional metadata, such as population data or administrative classifications, depending on your use case.

4. **Geometry**:
   - The **geometry** field defines the spatial shape of the feature. For Brazil, the geometry type is **"MultiPolygon"**, which allows the representation of the country's complex boundaries, including multiple distinct areas like islands or disjointed regions. This makes it ideal for use in applications that require detailed boundary mapping or geospatial analysis.
