## Example Queries

Here are some examples of how you can query the Country model to find countries based on different criteria. We'll start with simple queries and move towards a more complex one.

### Find a Country by ISO Alpha-2 Code

You can find a country using its ISO Alpha-2 code with the `whereIsoAlpha2` scope.

```php{1}
$country = Country::whereIsoAlpha2('US')->first();

echo $country->official_name; // Outputs: "United States of America"
```

### Search for Countries by Official Name Using LIKE

To search for countries where the official name contains a specific keyword, use the `whereOfficialNameLike` scope.

```php{1}
$countries = Country::whereOfficialNameLike('United')->get();

foreach ($countries as $country) {
    echo $country->official_name . "\n";
}

// Outputs:
// "United States of America"
// "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"
```

### Find Countries Matching Multiple Criteria

In this example, we're combining multiple query scopes and conditions to filter countries that match all the specified criteria. This demonstrates how powerful and flexible your queries can be when using the Country model.

```php
$countries = Country::where('population', '>', 180)
    ->where('independence_day', '<', Carbon::createFromDate(2000, 1, 1))
    ->where('area', '<', 1000000)
    ->whereCurrencyCode('EUR')
    ->whereLanguage('es')
    ->whereDomain('.es')
    ->get();

foreach ($countries as $country) {
    echo $country->officialName . "\n";
}

// Possible Output:
// "Kingdom of Spain"
```
