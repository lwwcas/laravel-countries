# Supported Databases

The **Laravel Countries** package has been tested and works perfectly with the following databases:

> **Note**: There is a very high chance that this package will work perfectly with other relational databases as well. However, since they have not been tested, we cannot guarantee full compatibility.

## **MySQL**

**MySQL** is one of the most popular relational databases, widely used in web applications.

- **Pros**:
  - High performance for read-heavy operations.
  - Strong support from the open-source community.
  - Supports complex queries and large datasets.

- **Cons**:
  - Can become slower with very large write operations.
  - Some advanced features (like full-text search) are less powerful compared to PostgreSQL.

## **SQLite**

**SQLite** is a lightweight, serverless database that stores data in a single file. Itâ€™s often used in testing or lightweight applications.

- **Pros**:
  - No setup required; the entire database is stored in a single file.
  - Fast for small to medium-sized applications or for development environments.

- **Cons**:
  - Not ideal for large-scale applications or high-concurrency environments.
  - Limited support for some advanced database features like complex JOINs.

## **PostgreSQL**

**PostgreSQL** is a highly advanced, open-source relational database known for its robustness and support for complex queries.

- **Pros**:
  - Supports complex queries, advanced indexing, and custom data types.
  - Great for large datasets and write-heavy operations.
  - Strong support for ACID compliance and data integrity.

- **Cons**:
  - Slightly more complex to configure and manage compared to MySQL.
  - Can require more resources (memory and storage) than simpler databases like SQLite.

Each of these databases offers unique strengths, and **Laravel Countries** works seamlessly with them, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your project's needs.
