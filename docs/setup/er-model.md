# ER model

An ER Model (Entity-Relationship Model) is a visual way to represent the structure of a database.

It helps you map out entities (like users or products), their attributes (like names or prices), and the relationships between them (like a user placing an order).

Think of it as a blueprint for how your data is connected, making it easier to design and understand how everything fits together in your application!
